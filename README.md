# Italian emigrants 2022

This project aims to show a graphical rappresentation of italians moving abroad in the year 2021-2022. 
The data were collected by A.I.R.E (Anagrafe Italiani Residenti all'Estero) and the dataset was downloaded from the official Italian minister [website](http://ucs.interno.gov.it/ucs/contenuti/Anagrafe_degli_italiani_residenti_all_estero_a.i.r.e._int_00041-8067961.htm)

(you could also find a copy of the dataset in this repository).

Another source of data was the Wikipedia's page of the italian subregions ([province](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_d%27Italia)), the table data was web scraped using the library "rvest". This second dataset was useful for calculating the rate of emigrants for each subregion and also to uniform the data. Indeed the primary dataset from AIRE is semi-structered and some data wrangling was necessary to extract the informations correctly.
